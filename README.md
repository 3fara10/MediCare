# MediCare - Patient & Appointment Management System (Java + Hibernate + MongoDB)
A Java-based system for managing patients, appointments, and medical records efficiently.

## Overview
**MediCare** is a healthcare management system that allows clinics and hospitals to:
- Register and manage patient records   
- Schedule, update, and cancel appointments   
- Use a relational and NoSQL database for efficient data storage  

This project demonstrates **Java programming**, **OOP principles**, **Hibernate ORM**, **MongoDB**, and **database management**.

##  Features
✔️ Register, update, and delete patient records  
✔️ Manage doctor appointments  
✔️ Use Sql Server and MongoDB for data persistence  

---

##  Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **Frameworks:** Hibernate ORM, MongoDB Java Driver  
- **Databases:** Sql Server / MongoDB  
- **Build Tool:** Maven  
- **JDBC & Transactions:** Database connectivity  

---

## Design Patterns Used
This project follows **industry-standard design patterns** to improve code maintainability and scalability:
- **Singleton Pattern** – Ensures only one instance of critical services.
- **Factory Pattern** – Used for creating objects dynamically.
- **Observer Pattern** – Enables event-driven programming for updates.
- **DAO (Data Access Object)** – Manages database interactions cleanly.
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** – Separates concerns for better maintainability.

## What I Learned
- **Database integration** with Hibernate and MongoDB  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**  
- **Efficient data handling and transactions**  
- **Implementing key design patterns for scalable applications**
